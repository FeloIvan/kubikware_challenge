## Briefly explain how you would solve this with AWS Glue / PySpark or EMR if you were dealing with a much larger dataset (terabytes) in AWS S3?
I would solve this setting up an AWS Glue Data Catalog and configuring AWS Glue environment,
first define a schema for the data in the Glue Data Catalog, then create a Glue Job using PySpark as the ETL language, this will define the transformation logic for the data. For dealing with a larger dataset (terabytes) I consider partitioning the data if is possible, this will allow to improve the performance of queries.  And create a partition data based on a column that is frequently used in your queries, for example a date, in another hand I will use parallelism to Leverage the distributed nature of PySpark to process data in parallel. AWS Glue handles the distribution of the data processing across multiple nodes in the Spark cluster, which helps in processing large datasets efficiently. Also consider data compression techniques to reduce the amount of data transferred and stored in S3. Compressed data can lead to faster processing times and reduced storage costs and incremental loading, if the dataset will be regularly updated, this consider implementing an incremental loading strategy to only process the delta changes since the last execution. This can reduce processing time and resource usage. Finally I will check the cost optimization monitoring the cost of the aws glue job to identify any issues and optimize performance over time.

Another approach is use a multipart upload, this allows an application to upload a large object as a set of smaller parts uploaded in parallel. Upon completion, S3 combines the smaller pieces into the original larger object, this strategy of breaking a large object upload into smaller pieces has a number of advantages. It can improve throughput by uploading a number of parts in parallel. It can also recover from a network error more quickly by only restarting the upload for the failed parts.

Multipart upload consists of:

1. Initiate the multipart upload and obtain an upload id via the CreateMultipartUpload API call.
2. Divide the large object into multiple parts, get a presigned URL for each part, and upload the parts of a large object in parallel via the UploadPart API call.
3. Complete the upload by calling the CompleteMultipartUpload API call.
 

## Briefly explain how you would develop a CI/CD process and what tools you would use to deploy your code to a Lambda.

I would use AWS CodePipeline to deploy code to an AWS Lambda function. This workflow will consider several AWS services, including AWS CodeBuild, AWS Lambda, and AWS CodePipeline.

This could be developed according to the following steps: 

Step 1: Create a New Lambda Function: Configure your Lambda function as needed, including specifying the function name, runtime, and IAM role. Write or upload the code for your Lambda function.
 
Step 2: Create a New CodePipeline: Enter a unique name for your pipeline in the “Pipeline name” field.

Step 3: Select Source Provider: In the “Source” section, select your source code provider. This could be AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, or another source. Configure the source settings as needed, including repository and branch.

Step 4: Configure the Build Stage: Select “AWS CodeBuild” as the build provider, then  “Create project” to configure a new CodeBuild project.

Step 5: Create a New CodeBuild Project: Entern name of you codebuild project, choose the os and the appropriate image 

Step 6: Attach Permissions to the CodeBuild Role: attach IAM permissions to the CodeBuild role to allow it to access AWS Lambda, S3, and any other resources your build process requires. Create IAM policies (e.g., codebuild-git-full.json, lambda-s3-access.json, lambda-ssm.json, lambda-update-code.json) with the necessary permissions and attach them to the CodeBuild role.

Step 7: Review and Create the Pipeline: Review the pipeline configuration to ensure everything is set up correctly. 

Step 8: Trigger the Pipeline: Whenever you push new code to your selected source code repository, the pipeline will automatically trigger a build and deploy process to update your Lambda function.

Finally is successfully set up a CI/CD pipeline to deploy code to an AWS Lambda function using AWS CodePipeline. Any changes made to the source code repository will now automatically trigger the pipeline, ensuring seamless and automated deployments to the Lambda function.
